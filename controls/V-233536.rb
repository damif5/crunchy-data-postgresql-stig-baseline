	desc	"It is critical that when PostgreSQL is at risk of failing to process audit logs as required, it take 
	action to mitigate the failure. Audit processing failures include software/hardware errors; failures in the 
	audit capturing mechanisms; and audit storage capacity being reached or exceeded. Responses to audit failure 
	depend upon the nature of the failure mode. 

When availability is an overriding concern, approved actions in response to an audit failure are as follows: 

(i) If the failure was caused by the lack of audit record storage capacity, PostgreSQL must continue generating 
audit records, and if possible (automatically restarting the audit service if necessary), overwriting the oldest 
audit records in a first-in-first-out manner.
(ii) If audit records are sent to a centralized collection server and communication with this server is lost or 
the server fails, PostgreSQL must queue audit records locally until communication is restored or until the audit 
records are retrieved manually. Upon restoration of the connection to the centralized collection server, action 
should be taken to synchronize the local audit data with the collection server.

Systems where availability is paramount will most likely be MAC I; the final determination is the prerogative of 
the application owner, subject to Authorizing Official concurrence. Sufficient auditing resources must be allocated 
to avoid audit data loss in all but the most extreme situations."

If PostgreSQL is auditing to a directory that is not being actively checked for availability of disk space, and if

creation of new audit logs, this is a finding.

removed to ensure sufficient space for newest logs, or oldest logs are not being replaced by newest logs, this is a
